CHRISTOPHER NOLAN is cinema’s leading time-traveller. Most writer-directors tell stories which go from beginning to end, bar the odd flashback, whereas Mr Nolan seems unwilling or unable to do anything so straightforward. In his breakthrough film, “Memento” (2000), the noir narrative was broken into ten-minute segments which were shuffled into reverse order. “The Prestige” (2006) juggled events in the characters’ present with two separate sequences from those same characters’ past. “Dunkirk” (2017) also plaited three distinct plot strands, one spanning a week, one a day, and one an hour—unusually ambitious stuff for a second world war drama. Beyond those brain-twisters, there are Mr Nolan’s science-fiction films, in which the characters are aware of time speeding up and slowing down. In “Inception” (2010), they jump from one dream to another, each one progressing at its own tempo. “Interstellar” (2014) sends an astronaut to a distant world where time creeps at a more sluggish pace than it does on earth; years pass for his children while mere hours slip by for him. Now Mr Nolan has written and directed another science-fiction thriller which takes this recurring theme and promotes it to a central premise. In “Tenet”, the first major Hollywood film to be shown in cinemas since the coronavirus pandemic began, time is something which can be stopped, rewound and replayed, if only you know which buttons to press. It begins in explosive fashion with a firefight in an opera house in Kiev, a breathless action scene with complicated choreography reminiscent of the Joker’s bank raid at the opening of “The Dark Knight” (2008), the second instalment in Mr Nolan’s Batman trilogy. Among the many terrorists and law-enforcement officers shooting at each other is an unnamed CIA agent played by John David Washington (pictured) who notices a bullet springing out of the floor and back into the barrel of a gun. Afterwards, he is introduced to a scientist (Clémence Poésy) who explains that the bullet isn’t unique: she has a laboratory full of weaponry and ammunition which appear to go backwards through time. Having accepted that these “inverted munitions” exist with barely a shrug—something which characters tend to do in Mr Nolan’s films—he sets off on a quest to find out where they come from. This entails flying from Mumbai to London to the Amalfi coast accompanied by a rakish English sidekick (Robert Pattinson), and contending with a malign, obscenely wealthy Ukrainian arms dealer (Kenneth Branagh) who has a trophy wife (Elizabeth Debicki) who loathes him. It also entails beating up thugs, scaling tall buildings and leaping off speeding vehicles, usually while wearing a tailored suit which never gets torn or crumpled. This is all fine if you are in the mood for a fast, polished but derivative James Bond-style spy movie. After so long away from the cinema, lots of viewers will be in just that mood, and Mr Nolan certainly serves up big-budget, big-screen thrills. But however fancy the arms dealer’s yacht may be, and however many of his goons the impeccably dressed hero punches, this section is also slightly disappointing. The fact is that there are plenty of directors who can make far-fetched global espionage capers: hence there is not just the Bond franchise, but the Jason Bourne franchise, “Mission: Impossible”, “Kingsman”, “The Fast and The Furious” and more. There is very little in the first 90 minutes of “Tenet” which hasn’t been in these movies already. Mr Nolan has always been vocal about his love of Bond films, but the generic spy high jinks which take up most of “Tenet” seem like a waste of his unique talent and perspective. Why is he remaking “Thunderball” when he could be playing all the beguiling temporal tricks which set him apart? It is only in the film’s last act that “Tenet” shows off what “inverted munitions” can do. There are brilliantly bewildering set-pieces in which some characters are going forwards in time while others are going backwards, and there are plot twists which are either ingenious or utterly perplexing depending on how many episodes of “Doctor Who” you have seen. There are, of course, numerous mentions of “the grandfather paradox”. But Mr Nolan doesn’t start on the time travel until he has got the Bond movie out of his system, and so he squanders the film’s most interesting and distinctive material by rushing through it at the end. “Tenet” runs for two and a half hours. It is tempting to believe that there was a four-hour edit in which the philosophical implications and visual possibilities of chrono-reversal were explored in more loving detail. In the current version, it feels as if Mr Nolan wanted to do more than the “inverted munitions”, but he ran out of time. “Tenet” will be released in British cinemas on August 26th and in select American cinemas from September 3rd
