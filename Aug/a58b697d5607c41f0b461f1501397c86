Although the majority of America’s tobacco and cotton farmers worked in the fields alongside their toiling slaves, Britain’s sugar barons made their fortunes from huge plantations thousands of miles away. John Gladstone, father of one of Britain’s longest-serving prime ministers, probably owned some of my own ancestors in British Guiana, but he outsourced the brutality of plantation life to his managers. Britain therefore never needed legal segregation to confine former slaves to the worst areas; the sharp, racial dividing-lines characteristic of most American counties are softened in Britain. And looking to the future, although American whites are on track to be a minority by mid-century, albeit the largest, there is little prospect that Britain will cease to be a white-majority nation in the foreseeable future. Still, black people in America and Britain have important challenges in common. On both sides of the Atlantic, most black groups seem superglued to the bottom rungs of society’s ladder. The sweeping changes to the labour market from automation and artificial intelligence are likely to make things worse, potentially eliminating jobs traditionally done by poor minorities. And black people sense they are being pushed down the political pecking order by other minority groups. By the middle of the century there will be nearly twice as many Hispanic Americans as there are the descendants of African slaves. Two of Britain’s three most senior cabinet posts are held by clever Tories of Indian heritage. Though a liberal can cheer the spectrum of hues at the upper echelons of government, it is also not hard to see why black people might feel marginalised and angry. Yet these issues didn’t figure much during the recent Black Lives Matter protests in America. Beyond ending police misconduct, no one quite knows what the protesters want to achieve—and the one thing we do know about the call to “defund the police” is that it won’t provide a single extra job or university place for a black teenager. Moreover, there is reason for unease at the complexion of the demonstrations: how come the #blm protests are, well, so white? The joke making the rounds in Portland, Oregon—one of America’s least diverse large cities, where almost four out of five residents are white—is that there are more Black Lives Matter signs on the streets than there are black people. Something similar was true of the demonstrations in the only town in the world that, according to a 2018 survey, out-hipsters Portland, which is Brighton, on England’s south coast. It also proclaims itself Britain’s unofficial gay capital. In July the #blm banners flew proudly alongside the rainbow flag at the head of some 5,000 marchers—predominantly, like the town itself, young and white. A month earlier in Bristol, a port in the west of England, most of the hands on the ropes that pulled down a statue of the slave-trader Edward Colston belonged to young, white protesters. Does this matter? A hostile reading would say that a movement which started as a black-led cause has been hijacked by far-left extremists and middle-class whites, and now owes more to Extinction Rebellion than to Malcolm X or Martin Luther King. In this view, the underlying economic and social obstacles to the advancement of black people have taken a back seat to a range of wider, revolutionary demands. However a more positive interpretation is that white people, particularly the young, have been galvanised by clear evidence of police mistreatment of minorities, supported by the cops’ own body-cameras. But it would be tragicomic if the principal response to the #blm movement turned out to be a boom in guilt therapy for the white middle classes. It will take more than a hashtag and a few unconscious-bias sessions to untangle the dense thicket of history, culture and economic discrimination that has left blacks chronically disadvantaged. There is plenty of snake oil on offer on both sides of the Atlantic. Britain’s chattering classes have been keen to learn from America’s academics. Tomes bemoaning “white privilege” are being devoured by the affluent credulous. But the phrase evokes snorts of derision in the poor, deindustrialised northern cities (British) and mid-western enclaves (American), where being white has offered no protection against the twin hurricanes of covid-19 and competition from China. The guff peddled by “anti-racist” academics includes advice to reject “objectivity”, “perfectionism” and “worship of the written word” as traits of alleged “white supremacy culture”. Such patronising nonsense simply threatens to deepen black disadvantage. Ambitious black parents tend to ignore fashionable talk about structural racism and repeat ad nauseam the message drummed into their own ears as minority children in white-majority nations: “You need to work twice as hard, so you can become twice as good as them. Then maybe you’ll get half as far.” (It’s probably the most important lecture I ever endured; my own offspring were not spared.) It’s a strain of thought increasingly championed in Britain by young minority thinkers such as Munira Mirza, the head of the prime minister’s Policy Unit, and Tony Sewell, an educator recently appointed by Boris Johnson to come up with a fresh, evidence-based approach to racial disparities. Ms Mirza and Mr Sewell, acknowledging the persistence of racial disadvantage, point out that the brutal overt racism of yesteryear is now rare in Britain. They are sceptical of the purveyors of “critical race theory,” who provide some of the intellectual underpinning for the Black Lives Matter movement. Instead they draw on a very different group of African-American thinkers, such as Thomas Sowell and John McWhorter, who rail against the characterisation of minorities as perpetual victims in need of white tutelage and leadership. But even they would accept that persistent racial disadvantage won’t be overcome just by whites being nicer or people of colour working harder. In 2003-12 when I headed Britain’s equality commissions, the individuals who felt the sting of racial disadvantage most keenly were dedicated junior doctors who would never become consultants, the reliable middle managers who would never be groomed for a board seat. These were people of colour who did everything asked of them by white society, but still knew they would never make it to the top table; they would weep openly in front of me. The bitter reality of racism for most is not one of random cruelty meted out by anonymous men in blue uniforms: it is of dreams denied, often by those you thought were friends and colleagues. So what would make a difference? And what can two nations separated by a common tongue learn from each other? First, restore honesty to language. Racial euphemisms mask the truth. In America, terminology for different groups has proliferated in response to the growth of new minorities—Latinx, for example, to encompass the wide range of Hispanic groups in America. Though often baffling to non-experts, these categories have the advantage of being analytically useful. In Britain, linguistic innovation has headed in the opposite direction, driven by activists who reckon that a single voice for all non-whites offers the prospect of greater influence. In London, the term BAME—Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic—is now widely used to describe anyone who is not white. It may be politically handy, but bunching together people of Indian, African and Caribbean heritage is part of the problem. They need to be treated as distinct. In fact, commingling them has even led to serious problems. It undermined efforts to understand the impact of covid-19, since treating minorities as a broad cohort erased crucial differences in how the disease affected racial groups. For instance, the descendants of Caribbean slaves are at higher risk of death than their biologically similar African-born cousins and their children. Of course, drawing such fine racial distinctions makes public officials uncomfortable. When it comes to minorities, politicians who claim their decisions are “guided by the science” tend to put race politics before logic, by lumping minority groups together. The result has been confusion and quite possibly unnecessary suffering and death. We need to drop catch-all terms like BAME and treat each ethnic group with the specificity and respect that it deserves. Second, we should come clean about the true state of racial discrimination, not least because things may not be quite as bad as they sometimes seem. In America Roland Fryer, an economist at Harvard University, has shown that although in many routine encounters with the police, blacks are treated much worse than average; whites are just as likely to be shot by cops. In Britain data gathered by David Goodhart at Policy Exchange, the government’s go-to think-tank (Ms Mirza and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are alumni) suggest something similar. Building on these findings, attention might shift to the more significant drivers of racial disadvantage, poor educational attainment by some groups, or the astonishing 50-percentage-point pay gap between the highest-paid ethnic group (Chinese) and the lowest (Bangladeshis). Third, use data. In America, companies with more than 100 employees are required to report annually on ethnic and gender composition and pay to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The British government, reluctant to impose regulations, two years ago promised that it would encourage companies to voluntarily collect information on ethnic pay gaps. Not much has happened: there is as yet no guidance on, for example, how many ethnic categories should be used. Ministers should get on with it. Thankfully, some local leaders aren’t waiting to be told. In an enterprising initiative, several of the largest employers in the northern city of Leeds have decided to pool their workforce diversity data. Their leaders think that if they know the truth, they’ll be better placed to do something about it. They’re right. It’s early days, but one way of closing the gap might be to attract more high-skilled people of colour. Leeds could look across the Atlantic at Schenectady, a small city in upstate New York. In the early 2000s, it attracted middle-class Caribbean immigrants away from the Big Apple by promising to build a cricket stadium and, more importantly, offering low-cost housing in run-down areas. Today, the city’s Caribbean population, once just a few hundred strong, has risen to more than 10,000. Finally, the complexion of leadership in companies and public bodies has to change. Literally. A recent study by Green Park, an executive-recruitment agency that I chair, showed that of the roughly 1,100 most-influential jobs in Britain, around 50 (less than 5%) were occupied by non-whites, who comprise 13% of the population. As Raj Tulsiani, Green Park’s chief executive, puts it: “It’s about power. You don’t change anything unless you’re in the room where the decisions get made.” According to a government-backed committee headed by Sir John Parker, more than a third of the companies in Britain’s FTSE 100 index do not have a single non-white board member. He has given them until the end of next year to meet his target of “One by 21”. To some it will sound like tokenism, but it has initiated an important conversation in boardrooms previously terrified of debating race at all. Sir John just might get his wish: there is a clear appetite for change. These reforms would help reduce racial disparities but not eliminate them. And just as there are differences in the origins of chronic racial disadvantage in Britain and America, there may be divergences in the countries’ futures too. America probably faces greater racial divisions, with separate minority groups locked in a battle for influence and supremacy. Britain, where the population of biracial citizens has surpassed 1m, may have an easier time of it. Many of the biracial Brits are children of the so-called “Windrush” generation, named for a ship that carried Caribbean migrants after the war. Based on data from the past two censuses, I calculate that by the end of the decade, the majority of Britons with a Caribbean heritage will also have white parents and grandparents. This by itself is not a recipe for racial harmony. But the blurring of racial boundaries may make race less of a determining—and divisive—factor in everyday life. To paraphrase one biracial individual, Barack Obama: It’s not so easy to be prejudiced against someone if he looks like your son—or son-in-law. It is sometimes said that eruptions over American race relations take place in every generation: the late 1960s, the 1990s and now the 2020s. Typically, they echo across Britain too. For now, many of the reforms to tackle discrimination, such as language and data reporting, flow eastward to Britain from its former colony. But the next time a generation rises, it may be Americans who look enviously across the Atlantic for lessons on how to make black lives matter. _____________________ Trevor Phillips is a journalist, businessman, former politician and the past chairman of Britain’s Equality and Human Rights Commission.
