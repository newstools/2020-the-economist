America faces a secondary surge of coronavirus cases not seen anywhere else in the world. Can America beat covid-19? This episode includes excerpts from CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield’s interview on “The Economist Asks” podcast. John Prideaux, The Economist’s US editor, hosts with Charlotte Howard, New York bureau chief, and Washington correspondent Jon Fasman.
