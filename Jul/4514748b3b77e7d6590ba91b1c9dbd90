“DEFUND THE POLICE” is a brilliant idea—in theory. It is an understandable, emotional reaction to the dramatic events of black people being killed by police; emotions that were felt by millions of people around the world. It is now time to think through how to translate this emotion into effective policy. Thoughtlessly reducing police budgets or police presence can cost thousands of additional black lives. Declines in policing following federal scrutiny of police departments in the midst of social unrest has led to dramatic increases in crime, according to a study that I conducted with Tanaya Devi of Harvard. A similar effect may be happening again. In just four weeks after the tragic killing of George Floyd on May 25th, murders rose by 79% in Chicago, by 31% in New York City and by 17% in Baltimore, compared with the same period a year earlier. They were mostly black lives. This is heartbreaking. All black lives matter: those that we have witnessed on videos tragically ended by police as well as those that we have not seen, cut short because of homicides that can engulf communities long after the media have moved on. Obviously police departments need systemic reform, but the details matter because it is us, black people, who pay the costs of policy guesswork. So let’s assess what the evidence over the past five decades has taught us. Using data on crime, police and a host of contextual variables for 242 large American cities over the period 1960 to 2010, the social scientists Aaron Chalfin and Justin McCrary provide estimates of the effect of police on crime. Surprisingly, police strength in cities like Chicago has fluctuated dramatically over the past 50 years, with the number of police officers typically varying by 10% each year. Similarly, in the early 1980s, a Massachusetts Supreme Court decision led to large reductions in revenue from property taxes. To help balance the budget, the city of Boston reduced the number of sworn officers by 24%. Making use of this type of variation across the cities, the study estimates that a 10% decrease in the number of police officers leads to a 3.4% increase in violent crimes and a 6.7% increase in homicides. Applying these estimates to the current plans to defund the police departments of New York ($1bn cut) and Los Angeles ($150m cut) suggests that between 700 and 2,000 more violent crimes will occur every year in these two cities, depending on whether each department implements a hiring freeze alone or also cuts overtime and other wages. Some will rightly argue that the study by Professors Chalfin and McCrary is based on administrative data and not a formal experiment, and that annual variation may pick up extraneous factors, such as the local economy, city budgets, social disorganisation, demographic factors and recent changes in crime. The pair go to great lengths to demonstrate that changes in police numbers are only weakly correlated with such potentially confounding factors. However because it is not a randomised experiment, you can never be certain. Finding random variation in police presence to estimate the impact of police on crime is exceedingly difficult, but has been done in at least one impressive case study. On July 7th 2005, terrorists detonated three bombs in London Underground trains across the city and one on a double-decker bus. In response, the total hours of policing in central London (relative to the outer boroughs) increased by over 30% in the six weeks following the bombings. Research by Mirko Draca, Stephen Machin and Robert Witt uses this event to estimate the causal impact of police presence on crime. The results are strikingly consistent with the work by Professors Chalfin and McCrary: a 10% increase in total police hours reduces crime by around 3-4%. Bolstering their findings, when police deployments returned to their pre-attack levels six weeks later, the crime rate rapidly returned to its pre-attack level. How do we get to a more ideal society that has fewer police and less crime? First, we need sweeping police reform that rids our cities of bad police without changing the behaviour of good police. This means encouraging the use of less force when possible through body cameras, and training officers on the appropriate level of force for different interactions. It also means linking federal funding to the collection of meticulous data so that we can monitor these goals and hold police departments accountable. Second, we need to create better opportunities in our most disadvantaged communities through affordable housing, job training and employment programmes. There is a rich collage of evidence suggesting that asthe difference between expected earnings from illegal activities versus legal jobs widens, individuals (especially youth) engage in more crime. Third, we need to refocus our attention, as a country, on providing a world-class education to every American, regardless of the colour of their skin or the wealth of their postal code. Education reforms such as early childhood investments, school choice, desegregation programmes and high-performing charter schools have all been shown to lead to substantial reductions in crime. A study by David Deming in 2011 used a lottery that let winners attend their first-choice high schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina. It showed that high-risk youth who win the lottery commit about 50% less crime. In another study that analysed students who won a random lottery to attend the Promise Academy charter school in the famed Harlem’s Children’s Zone, Will Dobbie and I demonstrated that not a single male lottery winner had been incarcerated by his senior year in high school (compared with 5% of the male lottery losers). Those are positive findings. In contrast, Professor Deming and his colleagues looked again at Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools, after race-based busing ended. In a study in 2014, they estimate that minority male students who are assigned to a school with ten percentage points more minority students are about 1.6 percentage points more likely to be arrested and 1.3 percentage points more likely to be incarcerated, demonstrating the perils of segregated schooling. Early childhood intervention for disadvantaged children also has beneficial effects. A study led by James Heckman analysed the HighScope Perry Preschool Project, which provided high-quality education to young children in the 1960s and tracked how their lives developed. It found that those who went through the programme were less likely to be arrested or go to prison (among other advantages, such as higher income and fewer teen pregnancies). The most expansive work on the relationship between education and crime was conducted by Lance Lochner and Enrico Moretti in 2004, using data on changes in compulsory schooling laws in 48 states and the District of Columbia between 1914 and 1974. They estimate that an increase of one percentage point in high-school graduation rates leads to 100,000 fewer crimes, 35,000 fewer violent crimes and nearly 400 fewer murders per year, nationwide. These outcomes would provide an estimated annual “social benefit” valued at more than $2bn. This is a conservative calculation using only the cost of crime and does not include other benefits of education. Similar findings have been reported in Britain and Sweden. Education may be our best crime-prevention strategy if we cherish black lives. Consider the following thought experiment. Imagine we came together as a country and did whatever it takes to ensure that 95% of black students graduate from high school. This 16-percentage-point increase, using Professors Lochner’s and Moretti’s estimates, might well reduce homicides by 37% and violent crimes by 46% per year. Following this logic, we would need significantly fewer police and the resulting $40bn annual social benefit could be used to continue to fund investments that make police less necessary. This approach is not as easy as defunding the police, closing our eyes and hoping for the best. It requires meaningful long-term investments in proven reforms across areas such as early childhood, education, desegregation, housing and job training. At this pivotal moment in American history, we should not be asking how many police officers to remove from disadvantaged neighbourhoods, but how fervently we can invest in these communities to reduce the need for police. ■ Roland Fryer is an economist at Harvard University.
