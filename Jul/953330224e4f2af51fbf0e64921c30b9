TWICE RECENTLY an eruption in middle America has shocked the world. Four years ago voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were decisive in putting Donald Trump in the White House. Two months ago, George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis prompted debate on racism everywhere. In a special episode on the Midwest, the region’s role in the 2020 election and America’s future, we hear from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, her predecessor Rahm Emmanuel, and get the latest from The Economist’s election forecast. Charlotte Howard, The Economist’s New York bureau chief, hosts with Washington correspondent Jon Fasman and Midwest correspondent Adam Roberts.
