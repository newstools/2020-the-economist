THE SIGNIFICANCE of the 2020 election in America was clear well before covid-19 hit. Americans will now be delivering a verdict on a transformative president amid the gravest crisis for generations. The Economist’s newest podcast, “Checks and Balance” launched as the crisis took hold. Our US Editor John Prideaux hosts, together with Charlotte Howard, New York bureau chief, and Washington correspondent Jon Fasman.

Every Friday, we take a theme shaping US politics and tap into America’s rich history to answer some big questions: Each episode draws on the rigour and expertise of The Economist’s journalists across the US and around the world to dig into the data, the ideas, and the history shaping the race for the White House.  Listen on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Stitcher | TuneIn On the latest episode of “Checks and Balance”, America is engulfed in its most widespread, sustained unrest since the late 1960s. It was sparked by an act of police brutality caught on camera. In the days since, Americans have seen police forces look more like an invading army than public servants sworn to protect their fellow citizens. Who will the politics of police versus protestors favour in 2020? We speak to Janeé Harteau, a former Minneapolis police chief, historian Khalil Gibran Muhammad, and Mitch Colvin, Mayor of Fayetteville, North Carolina. The podcast is complemented by our "Checks and Balance" newsletter, and in this package we aim to give our readers and listeners fair-minded analysis in what will be an emotionally charged media environment.
