THE SIGNIFICANCE of the 2020 election in America was clear well before covid-19 hit. Americans will now be delivering a verdict on a transformative president amid the gravest crisis for generations. The Economist’s newest podcast, “Checks and Balance” launched as the crisis took hold. Our US Editor John Prideaux hosts, together with Charlotte Howard, New York bureau chief, and Washington correspondent Jon Fasman. You can subscribe and listen to “Checks and Balance” on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Stitcher | TuneIn or wherever you get your podcasts. Every Friday, we take a theme shaping US politics and tap into America’s rich history to answer some big questions: Each episode draws on the rigour and expertise of The Economist’s journalists across the US and around the world to dig into the data, the ideas, and the history shaping the race for the White House.  On the latest episode of “Checks and Balance”, America has passed a grim milestone: 100,000 deaths from covid-19. Many Americans think the country has been hit uniquely hard and that the president’s bungled response is to blame. That view is not borne out by international comparisons. But, as all 50 states reopen with the virus still prevalent, Americans are right to be nervous. How will America’s efforts to recover impact the presidential race? Henry Curr, our economics editor, and US policy correspondent Idrees Kahloon join our hosts. The podcast is complemented by our "Checks and Balance" newsletter, and in this package we aim to give our readers and listeners fair-minded analysis in what will be an emotionally charged media environment.
