THE SIGNIFICANCE of the 2020 election in America was clear well before covid-19 hit. Americans will now be delivering a verdict on a transformative president amid the gravest crisis for generations. The Economist’s newest podcast, “Checks and Balance” launched as the crisis took hold. Our US Editor John Prideaux hosts, together with Charlotte Howard, New York bureau chief, and Washington correspondent Jon Fasman. You can subscribe and listen to “Checks and Balance” on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Stitcher | TuneIn or wherever you get your podcasts. Every Friday, we take a theme shaping US politics and tap into America’s rich history to answer some big questions: Each episode draws on the rigour and expertise of The Economist’s journalists across the US and around the world to dig into the data, the ideas, and the history shaping the race for the White House.  In the latest episode of “Checks and Balance”, Taiwanese firm TSMC plans to build a new fab, or computer chip factory, in Arizona. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the $12bn investment a boost for American “economic independence” amid China’s creeping dominance in tech. A geopolitical tug-of-war is being fought over nanoscopic wafers of silicon. What do microchips tell us about what’s happening to globalisation? And, as the coronavirus stokes anti-China sentiment, will trade barriers remain no matter who wins November’s election? Tech correspondent Hal Hodson and Soumaya Keynes, our trade editor, join our hosts. The podcast is complemented by our "Checks and Balance" newsletter, and in this package we aim to give our readers and listeners fair-minded analysis in what will be an emotionally charged media environment.
